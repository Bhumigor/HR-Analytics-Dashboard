# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard that efficiently tracks and analyzes key human resources metrics such as employee count, attrition rates, and demographic details across various departments. The dashboard will visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to support HR decisions related to workforce management and planning.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is the **HR_Analytics**, which is a compilation of employee records including demographics, job roles, salaries, and employment history.

## Key Insights to Explore
The dashboard will focus on providing insights into:

- **Employee Distribution and Demographics**: Track how different regions are performing in terms of total sales.
- **Attrition Rates**: Analyze attrition rates across different departments, salary bands, and demographics to identify patterns.
- **Compensation Analysis**: Review average salaries by job roles and departments to ensure competitive and equitable pay structures.
- **Employment Trends Over Time**: rack changes in employment and attrition over time to forecast staffing needs.
